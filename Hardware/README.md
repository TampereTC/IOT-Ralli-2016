###esp-link user interface:   
esp-link comes with very handy user interface. It is possible to configure and admistrate Wifi parameters, managing MQTT/REST parameters and also handling serial events from Arduino by the Web Browser. The UI allows to send and receive serial events. This feature makes life much easier in case of troubleshooting.
