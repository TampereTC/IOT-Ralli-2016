# IoT-Ralli-Vempain
The project aims to build up the IoT development environment for educational institutions. The project is based on easily available and low cost components. In addition, an important factor is the availability of the source code for hardware drivers. This project focuses on producing prototypes, where the Internet of Things (IoT) terminology will face the actual equipments and internet services.
