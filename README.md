# IoT-Ralli-Vempain
This project aims to develop Internet of Things (IoT) specific development environment for educational institutions. Easy availability and low cost components are the design princibles of the device. In addition, an important factor is the availability of the source code for hardware drivers. This project is focusing to produce a prototype device with needed the IoT features. The brains to control a robot can be placed in the cloud server, if necessary.
