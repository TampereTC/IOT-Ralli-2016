###Description of "IoT-Ralli-Vempain" project:
This project aims to develop Internet of Things (IoT) specific development environment for educational institutions. Easy availability and low cost components are the design princibles of the device. In addition, an important factor is the availability of the source code for hardware drivers. This project is focusing to produce a prototype device with required IoT features and interfaces. The brains to control a robot can be placed in the cloud server, if necessary.
Source code type of approach is mandatory. All used 3rd party libraries in this repository are also available on GITHUB repositories. Including selected hardware e.g Arduino and esp8266 both are based on the model of open source electronics.
